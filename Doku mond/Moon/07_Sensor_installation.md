## 3. Sensor installation and sealing

### 3.1 Install Hall and RTC

- 1x RTC (prebuild sensor)
- 1x Containment box prepared
- 1x Hall-sensor set

First paste both Hall-sensors with glue (gluegun) on the right inner side of the containment box below the screws from the rolls. The one with green jumper-cable in front the one with orange jumper-cable in the back.

Than paste the RTC in the mount on the Raspberry Pie mounting plate with the battery to the top. At least connect the jumper-cables from the Hall-sensors and RTC to the Raspberry Pi.

### 3.2 Install LMST and EMPT / CMPT

- 1x Containment box prepared
- 1x LMST (prepared sensor)
- 1x EMPT or CMPT (prepared sensors)
- 1x CAM (prepared sensor)
- 1x M10 threaded rod
- 1x M10 nut

Insert the cables for each prepared sensor through the defined holes. Than paste the LMST and EMPT/CMPT to the top of the containmentbox. Attach the CAM with the M10 threaded rod and tighten it with the M10 nut.

### 3.3 Final Steps

Connect all jumper-cables from the sensors to the Raspberry Pie.

Seal all space between the Sensor-phalanx and the containment box with silicon or glue. Further seal all openings from the inner side of the containment box leading to the sensors with silicon or glue.
