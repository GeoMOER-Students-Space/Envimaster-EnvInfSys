# Containment box preparation



- 1x Containment box
- 1x Set of hinges
- 2x Cable tie sockets
- 1x Raspberry Pi
- 1x Heat sink set for Raspberry Pi
- 1x Breadboard for jumper cables
- 1x Powerbank with USB power cable
- 1x Wireless charger
- 6x Rolls 
- 1x Raspberry Pi mounting plate
- 100 cm rope (3mm width)
- 30 cm rope (3mm width)



- 4x M4x12 screws
- 4x C2,9x13 screws
- 6x M4x16 raised countersunk-head screws
- 6x M4 safty nut
- 6x M4 washers
- 1x Jumper-cable male/female in red, black

### 1. Drilling holes and attachments

First drill the holes for the hinges with the template from the hinge set at the backside of the containment box. Use a 5mm drill which fit in template and than use a 6mm drill to expand the holes. Install the hinges with the given screws included in the set. Then drill the holes for the sensors on the top of the containment box with the [tower template](images/tower_template.png) . Further drill the holes with 3,5 mm drill for the rolls on both sides using [roll template](images/roll_template.png) .

At least drill the holes for the suspension cable with 4mm drill . Insert the rope in both holes and and fix the ropes with glue. The rope should be at least 80 cm long outside the containment box.  Make sure the glue seals off the drill holes completely. 

Paste the two cable tie sockets in the inner left side of the containment box (see picture below) and connect them with the 30 cm rope. Fix the rope with double knot.

### 2. Attach Rolls

Use the six M4x16 raised countersunk-head screws with washers from inside the containment box to attach the six rolls and secure them with the six safety nuts from outside. Use instant glue under the washers and safety nuts and finally tighten the screws and nuts to ensure water-resistance.



### 3. Install Raspy Pi and power supply

Use the four M4x12 screws to attach the Raspberry Pie mounting plate to the containment box. Then paste the heat sinks on the Raspberry Pie. Further put the Raspberry Pie on the sockets of the Raspberry Pie mounting plate with the USB-ports pointing to the right side and fix it with the four C2,9x13 screws.

Take one +/- part from the Breadboard and paste it on the bottom side of the Raspberry Pi mounting plate and connect it with the jumper-cables: red for (+) and black for (-).

Connect the USB-power-cable to the Raspberry Pi. Put the Powerbank on the inner side of the containment box cover.
